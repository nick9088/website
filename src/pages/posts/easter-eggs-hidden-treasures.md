We all saw easter eggs everywhere, while watching a movie, while playing videogames... **everywhere**

in this context, an easter egg is a hidden feature, message, or reference tucked away in a piece of work. These secrets can take many forms: a subtle visual reference to another work, a cheeky line of dialogue that only true fans would catch, or even a character cameo that holds a deeper meaning for long-time followers. The name "Easter egg" comes from the classic childhood activity of an Easter egg hunt, where people search for hidden objects, much like fans search for these hidden details in their favorite media.
